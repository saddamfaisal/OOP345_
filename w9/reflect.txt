/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/


I learn from this workshop how can I creat thread function by use the keyword thread 

then the name of the thread and implement the arguments of the function.I use binary file 

because is more faste specially when we have multi threads.I create by use the keyword ifstream

for read then allocate dynamic memory for content and then start the read by put the methode the 

name of the file.read(); .It is important to bind function because it gives a new function obje

and  acts and modifeis the function according to the desired result.The advantages of multi threa

It simplifies the way of writting the code and it improves the efficeiently and performance and make 

the code more readble and easer for modification.
