//> I have done all the coding by myselfand only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshopsand assignments.




After I did the workshop I learned from this workshop how to read file in command line 

by implying the file in the project and type the name of the file 

in the command line .I learned the use of chrono library whick include three multiple

function clocks ,time points,and duration.Then I learned how to 

define variable of type string .I learned the insetion operator 

which we usually use for output.I learned how to read file by using ifstream and how to end

reading by using eof also how to read space by use the method getline() as in the function Recordset(char*).

Also, I learned the important of use copy counstructur that will make less work with the same functionality.

The important and hardest part I learned move semantics wich allow us to move objects around 

and transfer the ownership of a resource possessed by object to another object.
