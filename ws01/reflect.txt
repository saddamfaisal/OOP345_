I learned from this workshop how I declare command line in the main function by 

writing the form int main() and the arguments between the brackets that will deal with them .

Then I learned the concept of linkage that means how the compiler views the files in the linker

during run the files.There are two types internal and external linkage.First,external linkage

is avariable defined globally that can be used in two or more units for example :g_sysclock

in our code .second, internal linkage will be see it in one coding unit that means we can

use it just in one file.The way to declare variable in the form of internal linkage provide 

the word static for example:for example static int counter in event.cpp .The usage is useful

to prevent complicated errors when we works with big projects with every call this variable 

will have a new that will save alot of time of define new variable to save the new value.

Also; I learned about static variable which is avariable keeps its lifetime till the end of 

the code when we declare it that means allocate once in the memory and does not deallocate 

as long as the program does .It is useful to achieve the programming purposes because it is 

easy to access that variable anytime and it has one instance that make it more efficient

performance in some programming cases.
