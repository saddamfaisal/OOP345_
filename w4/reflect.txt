I learned from this workshop how to declare array of addresses

dynamically by declare with pointer to pointer(**).Second,I learned a new

concept is similar to inheritance .It is a composition which form 

a strong relationship and also have objects from other class that means 

when we creat child object does not have lifecycle and if parent object 

delete the parent ,all child objects will also be deleted For instance :

if we delete the parent object reservation all the child objects in restaurants 

will die .The child objects  can not be created indepently.Third;

I lerarned the concept of aggregation .It is arelationship between the

child and parent objects , but the ownership of a child object can not belong 

to another objects and the child objects can be found independently without 

the parent objects.The difference of implementation of a compostion is make strong

relationship between child and parent ,the child object can not stay alive witout parent

and we can use with different parent.The aggregation forms weak relation between the 

parent and child objects and the child can stay independently without the parent objects 

and we can not use it with other parent objects.The difference between the implementation of 

move and copy functions in composition when you delete parent object you will not copy or move 

the child and parent while in aggregation when you delete the parent object and copy or move 

you will copy or move the child objects.I did find so difficulty in general during do the code.
