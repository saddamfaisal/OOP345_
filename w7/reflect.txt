/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/


After I did the workshope, I learned many of the new concepts in c++ language.

First,I learned the STL container concept which is acollection of objects of the 

same type .Sequance container is one of the basic types of container that controll

in the order of elements by using vector and list.Vector containers have their element 

stored contiguausc which means that can access the element not only by iterators ,but also 

by pointers elements.Seconf,I learned how I use numeric library that help to implement many

of the mathmatical operations .Third,I learned lambda expression which is away to define

anonymous function.It consists of three parts capture clause ,parameter list,and  lambada body.

STL function that I used
 sort I use it to sort elements in range.
 any_of to test any condition in the range if fulfill condition
 for_each to apply function to range
 copy_if to copy certain elements in range
 count_if to count elements fuifill the condition
 push_back to add elements to range

The advantages of use STL .It maked code reuse ,efficiency ,accurate and less bugging ,more readable and give us 
good knowledge of data structure and algorithms.

we could redesign sort function to prevent the client to specify an invalid string, 
 allowing any error to be detected by the compiler by take the ownership of source and using smart pointer classes.
