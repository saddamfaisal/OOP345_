By doing this workshop ,I learned how to declare class template by use the 

prefix keyword template and follow by the general form for instance:

template < class T, unsigned int N>class Set {};The purpose of use parameter type 

because we want to make the type general works with different types of data to reuse 

the code , readability and  effeciently of code we can define more than one data type
	 
 by using comma to separate between the kind of data. we can not define template function

inside the class when we define template function we have to write the template prototype again.

The template of function is different from the template of class we can declare it in the class and define it outside the class

compared to the normal class member which the declaration and defintion have to be in the header

file ,so when we run the code the compiler has both the declaration and defintion that does not

need to generat any defintion for class template.Then I learned the template inheritanec apply to generate data type and 

 pass it between the base and derived class.Also ,I learned the specialization we use it to do

template for special types of data except the fundamental data types .when we have  char pointer we have to use specialization

 by use the word template<> ,but the parametere supposed to be empty fter that we declare the special 

type meaningly.The reason for specializing the operator+= member function

because it has not have fundamenta types of data ,so we have to do template specializing.

The reason for use initial value to set the initial value for both templates .

The reason for defining class variable outside the class because we hav to define

 member function template  outside of the class according the member function template rules.
