/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/
I learned from this workshop how to use and designn class template and template function such as 

template the function void select(T test, std::list<const Vehicle*>& vehicles) at autoshop moduel and

ho to allocate and deallocate dynamically memory for objects of Vector .Second,I learned hoe to declare and deal

with lambada function which i use it to make my code more readability.Fourth ,I learned how to use the exception

from diferent types such as throw,try and catch which i used them in car moduel the purpose of use them to force

code to recognize the errors to achieve orogramming target.Finally,I did not face any difficult during do my project.


Why do you need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your vector?
we need to deallocate memory in vector because vector is class template defines data
and it has to be deallocated to prevent memory leak.


How can the function `loadData()` detect what went wrong?
we can make loadData detect the errors by use try and catch exceptions .


In this workshop you had to use `std::list<sdds::Vehicle*>` and `std::vector<sdds::Vehicle*>` to store a collection of vehicles as pointers.
 Could you have used `std::list<sdds::Vehicle>` and `std::vector<sdds::Vehicle>` instead? **Justify your answer?
we could not use std::list<sdds::Vehicle>` and `std::vector<sdds::Vehicle> because we need to recieve address of function to excuit the function inside vector 
as vector object stores elements contiguausly.
